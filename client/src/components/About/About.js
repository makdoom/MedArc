                    over the last decade, society has witnessed an explosion of
                    health-related technology, from electronic health records to
                    IoT fitness devices to low-cost whole genome sequencing.
                    Currently, data from these sources is largely siloed â€“ with
                    limited or no integration with other data sources. At{" "}
                    <span> MedArc</span>, we believe that the health industry is
                    at a tipping point. Technologies now exist that will break
                    down these silos and enable health data to be connected on a
                    global scale. <br />
                    <br />
                    Healthcare will be predictive, preventative and personal.
                    Healthcare will be accessible to every person, everywhere,
                    regardless of who they are, where they are, . And with each
                    new connection, our collective human intelligence will grow
                    stronger. <br />
                    <br />
                    <span>MedArc</span> was founded with one mission: to enable
                    this next era of health. We believe that each person
                    deserves to live their healthiest, happiest life, and that
                    data will democratize health on a both a global and an
                    individual level.
