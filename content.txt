ver the last decade, society has witnessed an explosion of health-related technology, from electronic health records to IoT fitness devices to low-cost whole genome sequencing. Currently, data from these sources is largely siloed – with limited or no integration with other data sources.

At BurstIQ, we believe that the health industry is at a tipping point. Technologies now exist that will break down these silos and enable health data to be connected on a global scale.

These connections will usher in the next era of health. One in which healthcare is customized to each person based on their own unique genomic, proteomic, medical, demographic, socioeconomic and social profile: their LifeGraph™. Healthcare will be predictive, preventative and personal. Healthcare will be accessible to every person, everywhere, regardless of who they are, where they are, or how much they can pay. And with each new connection, our collective human intelligence will grow stronger.

BurstIQ was founded with one mission: to enable this next era of health. We believe that each person deserves to live their healthiest, happiest life, and that data will democratize health on a both a global and an individual level.

The BurstIQ platform was purpose-built for this new era. It connects any data from any source in a global network of businesses, researchers and people – all connected directly to each other. Since BurstIQ was founded in 2015, the platform has grown into a full end-to-end blockchain enablement system, with blockchain-based big data management, consent and data sharing, cognitive computing, monetization and global data exchange. Our customers use the BurstIQ blockchain platform to build more, sell more, innovate more.
